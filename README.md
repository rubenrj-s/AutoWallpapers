## More information 
 
The goal is to increase my Android knowledge and have a sample of my code. When I have ideas or want to test some Android features, I will add them.

If you are an expert on Android and have arrived here, please do not hesitate to message me if you think something is wrong. I will fix it and mention you if you don't mind. I would like to get a mobile tecnology job so fix my own errors is really important to me.
